## Rules
The white stone player will have the first move. A stone can be placed on any spot
on the board in the first move. After this, each player takes turns and can place 
a stone on any spot that is adjacent to the opponent's previously placed stone.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to get the most lives by the end of the game. Lives
are a set of four stones of the same color in a row either, horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally. The game is over when all spots on the board are completely filled with
stones.
