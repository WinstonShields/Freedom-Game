## Dependencies
A browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge with JavaScript enabled.

## Rules
The white stone player will have the first move. A stone can be placed on any spot
on the board in the first move. After this, each player takes turns and can place 
a stone on any spot that is adjacent to the opponent's previously placed stone. The
last player can opt out of placing a stone on the last turn.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to get the most lives by the end of the game. Lives
are a set of exactly four stones of the same color in a row either, horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally. If a set of four stones in a row increases to five or more stones, the life is removed.
The game is over when all spots on the board are completely filled with
stones or if the last player opts to not place a stone on the board.

## How to Play
Open up index.html, and click on an empty spot on the board.
